<p class="intro">
 I am broadly interested in the application of IOT and wireless technologies that interact with and interpret (sense) the physical world, spanning both algorithm design as well as end-to-end system prototyping. I am guided by <a href="https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ayon/">Dr Ayon Chakraborty</a>. I am also a member of Sensing and Networked Systems Engineering(SENSE) Group at IIT Madras.</p>
